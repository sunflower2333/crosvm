//! The first thing a pseudo-unprotected VM runs.
//!
//! crosvm starts this VM with only a small lent region -- this shim and the device tree -- and
//! leaves the guest's real memory as a hole: declared to nobody, backed by nothing, until the host
//! SHAREs it as a Gunyah memparcel and the guest accepts it. The host cannot accept on the guest's
//! behalf (the resource manager refuses MEM_ACCEPT_FLAG_MAP_OTHER), so something inside the VM has
//! to do it before any payload runs. That is this.
//!
//! It does four things and then gets out of the way:
//!
//!   1. finds the resource manager's message-queue capabilities in the device tree,
//!   2. reads the handles the host left in the handoff page and accepts each parcel,
//!   3. points `/memory` at the window,
//!   4. jumps to the payload with x0 still holding the device tree.
//!
//! There is no jumping back and nothing patches the payload: it sits at its own address, and this
//! is simply what the hypervisor started instead.
