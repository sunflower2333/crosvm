//! Resolving a host audio endpoint from a stable name.
//!
//! AAudio identifies a device by an integer that the platform hands out per connection: unplug a
//! headset and plug it back in and the number is different, even though it is plainly the same
//! headset. Anything that wants to reopen a stream on "the device the user chose" therefore needs
//! a name that outlives the connection, and a way to turn that name back into today's number.
//!
//! The name is the one Android's own `AudioDeviceInfo` supports: its type and its address, as
//! `TYPE|address` -- a Bluetooth MAC, a USB card/device string, or nothing at all for the built-in
//! endpoints, of which there is one each. Moving a USB device to a different port changes its
//! address and so counts as a different endpoint; that is a deliberate limit, not an oversight.
//!
//! Native code cannot enumerate devices -- AAudio has no API for it and `AudioManager` is Java --
//! so the table is published by whoever launched the VM and re-read here. Doing the matching on
//! this side rather than being handed a number means a reconnection can be picked up without
//! asking anyone: the file changes, and the name is still the same name.
