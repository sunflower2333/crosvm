//! virtio-gunyah-accept: host->guest transport for VmAccept::Sync.
//!
//! vm_control runtime-SHAREs a memparcel to the protected guest, then asks the in-VM accept
//! module -- over this device -- to `gh_rm_mem_accept` it at the attach GPA (and to release it
//! before the host unshares). Queue 0 (requestq) carries host->guest requests written into
//! guest-posted device-writable buffers; queue 1 (completionq) carries guest->host completions.
//!
//! The host side of the round trip is `vm_control::drive_guest_accept`, which sends
//! [`GunyahAcceptRequest`] over a Tube whose other end this device's worker holds.
