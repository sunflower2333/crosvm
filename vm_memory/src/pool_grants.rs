//! Which parts of a growable pool are currently backed.
//!
//! A growable pool is declared to the guest at its full size but SHARE'd only in part at boot; the
//! guest asks for the rest at runtime. Somebody has to remember which step-sized slots have been
//! granted, and it has to be the host, for three separate reasons:
//!
//!   * **Label collisions.** A runtime SHARE is reclaimed by a label derived from the address
//!     (`gpa >> 12`), not by a handle looked up in a table -- see `runtime_unshare` in
//!     hypervisor/src/gunyah/mod.rs. Two live SHAREs at one address therefore collapse onto one
//!     label and the wrong one gets reclaimed. Nothing in crosvm could previously answer "is this
//!     address already shared", because no such table existed.
//!
//!   * **Request validation.** Grow and shrink requests arrive from the guest, so the range has to
//!     be checked against what the pool actually owns before it reaches the hypervisor.
//!
//!   * **Host access.** Reading an ungranted address in a declared window does NOT fault. Measured
//!     on device: a read returns zeros with no error, no log and a surviving VM, while a write
//!     kills the vcpu. The silent-zero direction is the dangerous one -- wrong data with nothing
//!     to show for it -- so the host's own accesses have to be gated on this table too, and gated
//!     for reads and not just writes.
//!
//! A grant is a variable-length extent, step-aligned, above the pre-allocated floor -- not a fixed
//! slot -- because one grant is one RM memparcel however large it is. The floor itself is not
//! represented: it is shared before boot under a different label space (the shm vdevice node's
//! region index rather than `gpa >> 12`) and so can never be reclaimed at runtime, which is
//! exactly what a floor should be.
