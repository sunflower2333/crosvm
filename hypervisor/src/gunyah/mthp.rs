//! Multi-size Transparent Huge Page (mTHP) preparation and LEND chunking
//! for Gunyah memory regions.
//!
//! Ported from QEMU gunyah-all.c `gunyah_add_mem()` which addresses several
//! Gunyah hypervisor memory defects:
//!
//! 1. Without THPs, an 8 GB guest needs ~2M page-table entries and exhausts
//!    the hypervisor's fixed-size page-table pool → ENOMEM crash.
//! 2. The kernel's `gunyah_gup_share_parcel()` calls `kcalloc()` for the
//!    entire region; for 8 GB that is 16 MB contiguous kernel memory which
//!    always fails on phones.  Splitting into 256 MB chunks keeps each
//!    `kcalloc` at ~512 KB.
//! 3. Demand-paging after LEND only pins one page at a time, missing THP.
