//! Long-term pinning probe for memory that is about to be handed to Gunyah.
//!
//! Every gunyah memory transfer -- the boot-time LEND of guest RAM, the boot SHARE of the GPU
//! pools, and each runtime SHARE of a host-visible blob -- ends in the kernel doing
//! `pin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_LONGTERM)` over the range. A page that sits in a CMA pageblock
//! cannot be pinned that way: the kernel must first migrate it to a non-movable pageblock, and
//! when there is nothing to migrate into, that step fails.
//!
//! On these phones shmem/memfd pages routinely land in CMA -- measured on all three test devices,
//! including the one whose reserve module has its CMA redirect hook turned off, because plain
//! `__GFP_MOVABLE` allocations may use CMA pageblocks. As long as the gh_hugepage reserve pool
//! serves the whole region the question never arises (its folios are already pinnable, and a
//! 3456 MB LEND takes ~60 ms). The moment the pool is short, the shortfall comes from ordinary
//! movable memory, part of it CMA, and the failure surfaces *inside* the gunyah ioctl -- where
//! the observed outcomes were a 2.5-minute whole-host stall ending in the kernel OOM-killing
//! crosvm, and a `qcom_scm: Assign memory protection call failed -22` that reset the phone.
//!
//! The cheap question is not "pin it" but "would pinning have to migrate anything?", and that
//! is a property of the pages: `/dev/gh_pinprobe` (gh_unmovable.ko) samples one page per 2MB and
//! reports how many sit in a CMA / isolate / ZONE_MOVABLE pageblock. It takes no long-term
//! reference and migrates nothing, so asking costs microseconds and cannot itself push a tight
//! system over. A pool-served region answers zero and goes straight to the ioctl.
//!
//! Only when the probe says migration WOULD be needed is there a decision to make, and the
//! default is to refuse -- that region came from outside the reserve pool, which is exactly the
//! condition that produced the two failures above. `GUNYAH_PIN_POLICY=fix` instead does the
//! migration deliberately, by taking the pin ourselves first, where the error is ours to handle:
//!
//!   * it forces exactly the same migration, at a cost measured at 0.1-0.85 s per 512 MB when
//!     pages really are in CMA and ~10 ms when they are not;
//!   * it fails as a plain `-ENOMEM` we can turn into "VM start refused" or "this blob request
//!     failed", instead of a hypervisor call we cannot take back;
//!   * and it leaves the pages migrated out of CMA, so the gunyah pin that follows needs no
//!     migration at all.
//!
//! The pin is released as soon as gunyah owns the memory (the LEND/SHARE ioctl has returned, and
//! for runtime blobs the guest has accepted or failed to accept). Migration is not undone by
//! unpinning -- the pages stay where they were moved to -- so the pin is a lever, not a lease.
//! Holding it any longer would only add a second owner to the release path, and a slow release
//! is what this whole mechanism exists to avoid.
//!
//! The pinning is done through io_uring's `IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS`, which is
//! `pin_user_pages(FOLL_WRITE | FOLL_LONGTERM)` and nothing else; `IORING_UNREGISTER_BUFFERS`
//! (and closing the ring) is `unpin_user_pages`. That keeps this entirely in userspace: no new
//! kernel module, no new ioctl, and identical behaviour on the 6.1 / 6.6 / 6.12 KMIs (verified
//! present and permitted on all three test devices).
//!
//! Environment overrides, for bringing this up and for testing the refusal paths:
//!   * `GUNYAH_PIN=0`            -- skip all of this (pre-probe behaviour).
//!   * `GUNYAH_PIN_POLICY=fix`   -- when the probe reports unpinnable pages, migrate them (by
//!                                  pinning) instead of refusing.
//!   * `GUNYAH_PIN_FAIL=preboot` -- pretend every pre-boot probe fails.
//!   * `GUNYAH_PIN_FAIL=share`   -- pretend every runtime-share probe fails.
//!   * `GUNYAH_PIN_FAIL=all`     -- both.

    /// Migration is not something this process performs; it is what the kernel does inside a
    /// `FOLL_LONGTERM` pin, so taking the pin ourselves is how it is asked for -- and the pin is
    /// also the answer: if the migration could not find anywhere to move a page to, the pin
    /// fails, and that error is this function's error.
    ///
    /// The pin is then HELD, all the way through the hypervisor call the caller is about to make.
    /// That is not just convenience. Measured on device: unpinning first, collapsing the region
    /// again to repair any folio the migration had split, and re-probing, left 57 of 1728 samples
    /// back in CMA when the reserve was empty -- the repair pass allocated fresh pages, the
    /// reserve had none, and the buddy allocator handed back exactly the memory that had just
    /// been migrated away from. Holding the pin makes that impossible: a pinned page cannot be
    /// migrated, by us or by anyone else.
    ///
    /// What is therefore not verified is the folio order after migration. The kernel allocates a
    /// same-order target where it can and falls back to 4 KB pages where it cannot, so a region
    /// can in principle come back more fragmented than the collapse pass left it, and the parcel
    /// shape the caller computes is from the pre-migration map. Nothing observed has needed that
    /// yet -- the coverage logged below is what to check first if an RM call ever fails after a
    /// migration.
