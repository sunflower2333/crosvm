/// Give the `SharedFramebuffer` region the pool-style preparation the LEND'd regions get, and say
/// whether what came back can be handed to something that will hold references on it.
///
/// This region is the one SHARE'd region nothing populates at boot. That is deliberate and it used
/// to be free: the guest ioremap_wc()s it, the host bridge reads it, and each side's first touch
/// faulted in an ordinary 4 KiB shmem page. Those faults are order-0, and the gh_hugepage reserve
/// only hooks order-9 -- so every page of this region came from the buddy allocator, `__GFP_MOVABLE`,
/// and under pressure landed in CMA. The CPU bridge survives that, because nothing holds a
/// long-lived reference and gunyah's fault-time `FOLL_LONGTERM` pin is free to migrate the page out
/// of CMA before mapping it. The GPU bridge does not: GKI 6.6's udmabuf takes its pages with
/// `shmem_read_mapping_page`, which is a reference and not a pin, and a referenced page cannot be
/// migrated. The guest then faults, the pin has nowhere to move the page to, and the vcpu dies of
/// `page fault at <gpa>, attempt: -12` about eighty milliseconds after `transport=gpu-blit`.
///
/// The ordering is the whole fix. Populate and collapse the region to 2 MiB folios HERE -- before
/// vcpus run, before the bridge exists, before anything can reference a page -- and the order-9
/// allocations go through the reserve's hook, so the pages arrive pool-served and non-movable and
/// stay where they are. Nothing later has to move anything, so nothing later can fail to.
///
/// What this deliberately does NOT do is the rest of `prepare_lend_region`. No mlock: this region
/// is not LENT, the host keeps its mapping, and the folios are already unmigratable for the reason
/// above. No dcache clean to PoC: that exists because the LEND path writes guest RAM through a
/// cacheable mapping that a non-coherent GPU then reads; here the region's only writer before boot
/// is this populate, and the guest maps it write-combining and owns it from GH_VM_START on. No LEND
/// chunking: there is no parcel to split, this stays a single whole-region SHARE.
///
/// The folding happens through the region's OWN mapping rather than a temporary one, and that is
/// not an optimisation. A collapse driven through a mapping that is then unmapped leaves the folios
/// in the page cache and this process's page tables empty, so every later reader of the region --
/// the pin probe first among them -- finds an absent page and cannot tell a prepared region from an
/// untouched one. Folding in place leaves the range populated in the mapping everything else uses.
///
/// `MADV_COLLAPSE` on a file mapping only forms a PMD where the virtual address and the file offset
/// are congruent mod 2 MiB, so that is checked rather than assumed -- misaligned, it would quietly
/// return 0% coverage instead of an explanation. The region is 2 MiB-granular by construction
/// (`get_simplefb_size` rounds the framebuffer up under a 2 MiB-aligned swiotlb base) and its
/// mapping is 2 MiB-aligned by request (`MemoryRegionOptions::align`, as the pools do it), so the
/// check is a guard on those two facts rather than a coin toss.
