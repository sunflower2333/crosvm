 * the frame to each registered consumer; compositing the cursor into an outgoing framebuffer is
 * one consumer's job, not this function's. See vnc_frame_consumer.h.
 *
 * `gpu_blit_ctx`/`gpu_import_id` describe the same picture as `clean` while it is still a GPU
 * object -- the guest dmabuf the producer imported -- for a consumer that would rather blit it
 * than read it. NULL/0 says there is no such thing for this frame, which is the answer on the CPU
 * transport and on every cursor-only update. They are arguments rather than state on the server
 * because the handle is only valid for the length of this call.
 *
 * `clean` is the guest scanout with NO cursor in it, and stays that way -- keeping a pristine
 * copy is what removes the need for LibVNCServer's save-under-cursor bookkeeping entirely: the
 * area the cursor used to cover is restored by copying from `clean`, never by remembering what
 * was underneath.
 *
 * full=1 for a new guest frame. full=0 for a cursor move, where not one guest pixel changed and
 * only the pointer's old and new rectangles are in play -- that is what lets the pointer keep
 * moving over a completely static desktop without pushing a whole frame. */

 * at all. The lookup is called by the broadcaster itself: its LibVNCServer protocol extension is
 * process-global while brokers are per-screen, so every per-client callback has to get from a
 * client back to the right one -- and `screenData` is the bridge's own field, whose meaning is not
 * something another file should have to know.
 *

 * thread has been joined and nothing can reach it through a screen any more. */
