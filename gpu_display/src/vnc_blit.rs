//! The VNC sink's GPU half: a Vulkan blit into a buffer the CPU can read.
//!
//! The machinery is the native sink's, used headless. `crosvm_android_display_client.cpp` already
//! kept its Vulkan bridge free of anything screen-shaped -- it takes a dmabuf fd in and an
//! `AHardwareBuffer*` out -- so the whole of this is the same import, the same blit and the same
//! fence, against a target allocated with CPU-read usage instead of dequeued from an app's Surface.
//! There is no second Vulkan stack here and there must never be one: a colour or layout rule that
//! held on one of them and not the other would be invisible until somebody compared two screens.
//!
//! What the VNC sink gets out of it is not "no copy". It has to put pixels on a socket, so a
//! readback is structural. What it gets is that the copy happens on the GPU, straight out of the
//! guest's own pages, with the channel-order conversion folded into it -- and that what the CPU
//! then touches is ordinary cached host memory rather than a write-combining guest mapping.

/// target the GPU is still writing produces a torn frame that reports nothing. That is the opposite
/// of the simplefb bridge's flip fence, which is a pacing device and may be overrun -- there the
/// source is guest memory nobody synchronises anyway, here it is our own buffer and the wait is the
