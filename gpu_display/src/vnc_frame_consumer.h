/* The seam between "a frame was offered" and "somebody does something with it".
 *
 * Above the seam is ingest, and it runs once per offered frame no matter how many consumers
 * there are: clip the producer's buffer to the screen, compare it against the frame before it,
 * hand down the answer. Below the seam is one consumer at a time.
 *
 * The split exists because the two consumers this sink is growing want opposite things out of
 * the same frame. LibVNCServer wants to touch as little as possible -- the whole point of the
 * band damage is that a static desktop costs nothing -- while a hardware H.264 encoder wants the
 * entire picture every time, because that is what a codec swallows. An offer therefore carries
 * both: the whole frame, AND what part of it is new. Neither consumer has to know the other
 * exists, and neither of them repeats the comparison.
 *
 * The LibVNCServer consumer is registered internally when the server is created and is not
 * configurable. The H.264 one is registered by the Rust sink between `vnc_server_create` and
 * `vnc_server_start`, because whether it exists at all is a property of the binding (its transport
 * ceiling) that this file has no way to learn.
