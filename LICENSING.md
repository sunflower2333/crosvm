# Licensing

This repository holds two kinds of material and they are licensed differently.

## Material inherited from upstream

- **crosvm** (BSD-3-Clause) — https://chromium.googlesource.com/crosvm/crosvm

Every file that came from an upstream project stays under that project's
license. Nothing here relicenses it, and modifications to those files do not
relicense them either — a patched upstream file is still an upstream file.

## Material written for DroidVM

Files carrying `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later` are DroidVM work
and are licensed under the GNU GPL, version 2 or later, **with the
additional permissions in `ADDITIONAL-PERMISSIONS`** — with the exception of the
two ported files named under *Third-party material* below, which carry the same
tag because that is the license they came with.

Those permissions exist so this work can go upstream. They let anyone
relicense it under the terms an upstream project requires, for the purpose of
getting it merged there — and only for that purpose. Once upstream publishes
it, upstream's license governs that copy.

## Third-party material that is neither

Two added files are Rust ports of QEMU code and are **not** DroidVM-original:

- `hypervisor/src/gunyah/mthp.rs` — ported from QEMU's `gunyah_add_mem()`
- `devices/src/pl061.rs` — a translation of QEMU's `hw/gpio/pl061.c`

QEMU is GPL-licensed. They carry `GPL-2.0-or-later` like the rest of DroidVM's
work here, but they carry it as QEMU's own license rather than as this project's
choice, and the additional permissions do not extend to QEMU's copyright in
them. Sending either of them anywhere needs QEMU's license honoured, not this
project's.

`gpu_display/src/vnc_server_bridge.{c,h}` are DroidVM-written but link
LibVNCServer (GPL-2.0-or-later); no LibVNCServer code is copied in.

`hypervisor/src/gunyah/gunyah_sys/bindings.rs` is bindgen output over Linux
UAPI headers. DroidVM's additions to it are ABI declarations, not expression.
