//! Runs the virtio-snd audio backend in a child process under an unprivileged uid.
//!
//! Android decides whether a stream is audible from the uid that opened it, and silences uid 0 in
//! both directions -- playback comes out at -inf dB, capture returns zeroes. crosvm runs as root,
//! so an in-process audio device is muted by the platform no matter what it does. The way out is
//! for the audio backend to live in a process that is not root and talk to the VMM over
//! vhost-user.
//!
//! Two things about the shape of this are deliberate:
//!
//! * **exec, not just fork.** A bare fork is cheaper and crosvm already has the machinery for it
//!   (see `ext2::launch`), but the child has to reach `audioserver` over binder, and libbinder's
//!   state -- its `/dev/binder` fd and its thread pool -- does not survive a fork. crosvm has
//!   already initialised binder by this point for the Android display service. exec buys the
//!   child a clean address space, which is precisely what it needs.
//! * **socketpair, not a socket file.** vhost-user is just a protocol over a `SOCK_STREAM`; a
//!   filesystem path only exists so that two unrelated processes can find each other. Here they
//!   are related, so the fd is inherited: nothing to place in the filesystem, no rendezvous, and
//!   no window in which the VMM has to poll for the backend to come up.
